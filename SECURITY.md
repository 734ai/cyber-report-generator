# Security

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the maintainers directly instead of opening a public issue.

## Best practices

- **Do not commit** `huggingface-api.json`, `.env`, or any files containing API keys or secrets
- Use `.env.example` as a template; keep credentials in `.env` (gitignored)
- Do not paste sensitive or real PII in the public demo
